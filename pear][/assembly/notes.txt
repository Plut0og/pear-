PASSES

*1st Pass //need to know if we can compile the line

//does the line have an instruction
    //if not
        //dont compile anything
//if so

//does the line have a tag
    //is it preprocessor
        //if so
            //process tag
        //if not
            //store the tag so that it knows it be processed

//does the line have a tag operand
    //if so,
        //is it defined
    //if not
        //we cant compile

    process all prepro tags
    compile all the lines we can
    any line that we cant process a tag on whether it be an operand or just a instruction tag
we add to a list

*2nd Pass //need to know how big every instruction is
//if the line was processed previously #no processing necessary
//if the line utilizes preprocessor tags
    //if so
        //is the tag defined
            //if so
                //how big is its value
    //if not
        //if the instruction is a jump or branching #3 bytes or 2 bytes

    iterate over the entire program adding to the program pointer
    process all instruction tags
    any unknown tag operands become 3 bytes if they are absolute and 2 bytes if they are branching

*3rd Pass //need to know all unprocessed operands and have a complete symbol table
//is the tag defined
    //if so
        //what is its value
        //what is its type
    //if not
        //error

    iterate over all lines with unprocessed operands
    return an error on any lines that dont have a valid operand

*4th Pass //need to know where the code should be written (size of all instructions and preprocessor commands that change write location)

    final compilation with a counter pointer and a location pointer

UTILS TO HAVE

*tags

    is tag defined
    is tag preprocessor/is tag instruction
    how big is the tags value

*lines

    is tag preprocessor

    there is something to compile
        tag is preprocessor
            tag is defined
    determine operand value
        parse operand
            eval all tags

decode operand output

1100 1111
msb bit - unprocessed tag
7th bit - no tag value
lsn - id value
